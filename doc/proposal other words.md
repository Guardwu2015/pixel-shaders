I believe we are witnessing the emergence of a new generation of programmers. These "alternative programmers" are artists, makers, and other creative explorers who do not self-identify as programmers, but who regularly program computers in order to achieve their goals. With this emerging generation comes the chance to radically change the way that we use and think about computers.

However, most of the programming tools and learning resources that exist today propagate traditional ways of thinking about programming. Their approach mirrors the traditional computer processing architecture--the CPU. Our programs are linear sequences of actions. These actions are precisely coordinated by a central control.

This paradigm can be effective, but it is also limiting to those who do not naturally think in these terms. It also is a disservice to emerging technologies which are massively parallel (GPUs, FPGAs) and distributed (cloud computing, mobile devices).

































I believe we set the standard too low for our learning resources.






I think most people, looking back, can recall having this feeling at some point, usually as a child discovering some new, wondrousness pocket of the universe. For me, I recall it most vividly upon my discovery of Martin Gardner books as a precocious kid. The feeling seems to come less often as we grow up, and our natural compulsion to learn is masked by various societal pressures.


But this is the feeling that I hope to recapture with this book.


















These interactions will be authored in tandem with the content of the book.



With this book, I intend to confront this problem on two fronts. First, the book will be targeted at a new audience of programmers, and will teach programming from a different perspective. 




Some alternative programmers take well to the current ecosystem of programming tools. But certain creative workflows--for example non-linear exploration and improvisation--are inadequately accommodated by the traditional programming infrastructure.


But other times there is a cognitive dissonance between the way the programming tool wants us to work and the way we work 

Traditional approaches to programming in many ways mirror the traditional computer processing architecture--the CPU. Our programs are linear sequences of actions. These actions are precisely coordinated by a central control.

This paradigm can be effective, but it is also limiting to those who do not think in these terms. With increasing frequency, 


This paradigm has served us well, but in many ways it is __ to an emerging generation of programmers--

Many of our most profound advances in computing stem from enabling a new group of people to richly interact with computers.





The way we think about computers today is far from the true potential of human-computer collaboration.


Computer programming, like other scientific disciplines, undergoes paradigm shifts. Previous shifts include structured programming and object-oriented programming. These shifts take decades. They often only occur when a new generation replaces an old one.



Traditional programming encourages us to take the perspective of the CPU. We model our program as a sequence of actions, with centralized control.





Our program is a linear sequence of actions. Control is centralized within a single thread.










To give an example, computers used to be thought of as mainframes--giant calculators. People wrote programs, then fed them to the computer which would chug and spit out an answer. Serious computer programmers worked on artificial intelligence, the vision of a computer which we could feed any problem and it would tell us what to do. But a small group of researchers, inspired by Vannevar Bush’s hypothetical memex, instead worked on augmented intelligence, the vision of human and computer working together in real-time, the computer augmenting the human intellect. The Augmentation Research Center, between 1962 and 1970, invented bitmapped screens, the mouse, hypertext, the GUI, and the internet.

The guiding principle behind this project was that computers and the human intellect must co-evolve. The technology we have affects the way we process information (the way we think), which in turn affects the technology we develop.






Programming is currently the richest collaboration we have with computers. But traditional approaches to programming encourage us to write programs which are sequential, imperative, and with centralized control.







The computer programming community, like other scientific communities, undergoes paradigm shifts. Previous shifts include structured programming and object-oriented programming. These shifts take decades. They often only occur when a new generation replaces an old one.

I see a new generation of programmers emerging–artists and creatives who program computers to realize their visions, but who do not come from a traditional programming background. This generation provides the potential for another paradigm shift.

Unfortunately, the tools and languages that exist today for the “creative coders” in many ways propagate the old ways of thinking. The programs they encourage us to write are sequential, imperative, and with centralized control. These paradigms can be effective, but in my experience they are often limiting to those who do not think in these terms. They also do a disservice to emerging technologies which are massively parallel (GPUs, FPGAs) and distributed (cloud, mobile devices).

New programming tools must allow creatives to more effectively and faithfully realize their visions, while also promoting an understanding (through doing!) of the mathematical principles at the heart of computing.




Alternative programmers

introduces an alternative style of programming--using the GPU instead of the CPU--to an alternative programming audience--artists and visual thinkers.



I believe that the ways we interact with computers today are far from the true potential of human-computer collaboration. Traditional programming is currently the richest collaboration we have with computers, but traditional programming privileges a logical, linear mindset. This

Graphics card programming is an unlikely target for an introductory programming book. But it has several advantages over traditional programming that I would like to fully explore with this book:

1. The programmer is immediately rewarded with rich graphical feedback.
2. Parallel
3. Small
4. Alternative
