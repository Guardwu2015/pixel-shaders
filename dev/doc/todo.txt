rgba output, sampling pixels

document the options on each of the ko.bindingHandler's



pass in position reactively
add +=, etc operators
add dot, etc


make grid labels skooch in to be visible



make annotations accept images, etc.
in parsing uniforms, update incrementally (saving values, etc.)

widgets for controlling uniforms
slider on x/y axis

build graph

build exercises



think about
  how fullscreen would work
  having shaders "active" (when scrolled within view)









snapping on panZoom or reset
turn on/off grid
mouseover to view position / resulting color



full screen




Minor todo
  make parse not capture parentheses as a group
  build codemirror out of stuff in lib (to make upgrading easier and cleaner)
