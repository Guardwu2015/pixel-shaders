deconstruct for graph
graph exercises
fix single line formatting right



introduction
  cpu vs gpu animation
  pixel zoom in / zoom out glsl code


component
  figure out what to do about weird image referencing problem with component
  update component/tip or switch it out for error message
  build codemirror out of stuff in lib (to make upgrading easier and cleaner)



rgba output, sampling pixels

document the options on each of the ko.bindingHandler's



add +=, etc operators
add dot, etc
gl_FragColor "sampling" as output


make grid labels skooch in to be visible
add "crosshairs" to show position
make position "pinable"


make annotations accept images, etc.
in parsing uniforms, update incrementally (saving values, etc.)

widgets for controlling uniforms
slider on x/y axis

build graph




think about
  how fullscreen would work
  having shaders "active" (when scrolled within view)









snapping on panZoom or reset
turn on/off grid
mouseover to view position / resulting color




Minor todo
  make parse not capture parentheses as a group

Book
  abs
  graph
  arbitrary uniforms
  variables and vectors
